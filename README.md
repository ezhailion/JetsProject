# JetsProject

# Description
Hello welcome to my Jets project, with this application it takes data from a text file and reads it into an arraylist,
with several different displays of modifying the list and using the data to perform different actions. 

The application will display you with a method to perform actions with and interact with the list. If you wish to quit, simply select the number 9 at any given time and the application will close.

# Lessons Learned
- Abstraction, determining what classes and interfaces will be required to perform the functions necessary.

- Inheritance, All of the fields being used in every subclass, the airfield, and in the app were originally declared in the jets superclass

- Polymorphism, each subclass performed their own niche function while maintaining the original data and function of the program from the superclass

- Encapsulation, Each field in every class was declared as private so it would protect each ones data properly. 

- Arraylists and IOStreams, I learned how to implement IOStreams to help read the data from txt files to input into a list, as well as utilizing string.split. 

- Casting objects vs. Primitives, throughout the project you will see a few instances of both casting from a primitive and objects. You'll find you often will find yourself needing to cast to reach a more desireable result from your code when dealing with formatting and downcasting from a superclass object for conditional statements to not be so niche.
